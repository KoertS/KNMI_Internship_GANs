# Nowcasting Precipitation using GANs

## GANs on MNIST
In [this folder](https://github.com/KoertS/KNMI_Internship_GANs/tree/main/dcgan_MNIST) I apply a conditional GAN to a hand written number dataset in order to gain some more experience with GANs and cGANs.

## GANs on precipitation data

[Here](https://github.com/KoertS/KNMI_Internship_GANs/tree/main/dcgan_MNIST) I work with the precipitation radar data. Currently working on preprocessing the data and matching the input data (raw radar data) with the output data (aart's corrected radar data).

## Paper
Work in progress of the paper I'm writing can be found in [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nqbdxkjnnqyv).
