# KNMI Internship GANs

In [this folder](https://github.com/KoertS/KNMI_Internship_GANs/tree/main/dcgan_MNIST) I apply a conditional GAN to a hand written number dataset in order to gain some more experience with GANs and cGANs.

Work in progress of the paper I'm writing can be found in [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nqbdxkjnnqyv).
